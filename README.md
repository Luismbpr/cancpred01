## About Project
<p> Machine Learning Project to predict Breast Cancer</p>
<p> Dataset Analysis.</p>
<p> Model creation.</p>
<p> Model deployment.</p>


## Project Information
The dataset is comprised of mutliple features which are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).
The dataset contains information about whether those cells were benign or malignant.
